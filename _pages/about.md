<p style="font-size:40px;"> hi! </p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">I'm a graduate student researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. </p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">I work in the <a href="http://concepts.psych.wisc.edu/"><b>Knowledge and Concepts Lab</b></a>, where I study individual differences in color perception. 

In my 5 years at UW-Madison, I have gained experience in experimental design (including survey design and <br>A/B testing), programming, statistical analysis, and science communication. I have presented this research at several conferences, including Vision Sciences Society and IEEE VIS. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">In addition to my graduate program, I am an intern at Sandia National Labs, since summer 2024. There, I have been involved in several projects, including a study on how the colors used in hazard maps affect people's evacuation choices, as well as several survey studies analyzing the effectiveness of apprenticeship programs and the information management needs of several teams at Sandia.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">Before graduate school, I completed a BS in Psychology at the University  <br> of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There, I did research in Diane Beck's<br> <a href="https://becklab.beckman.illinois.edu/"><b>Attention and Perception Lab</b></a>, where I used EEG to investigate how alpha<br> oscillations influence detection of sights and sounds.</p>
