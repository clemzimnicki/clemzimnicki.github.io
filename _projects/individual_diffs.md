research has established that there are significant individual differences in color perception, resulting from language spoken, geographical location, and even whether a person is a "day lark" or "night owl." 

in this line of research, I have aimed to understand if there is structure in these individual differences, or if people differ randomly. I have done so using triadic comparisons---a task in which participants judge which of two colors is more similar to an example color. so far, I have found that people fall into clusters: some judge color similarity based on lightness, and some based on hue!
