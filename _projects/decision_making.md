<p style="font-size:40px;"> how does visualization design affect decision-making? </p>

with Laura Matzen, I found evidence that the colors in a visualization can also affect people's decisions---for example, redder and darker colors in hazard maps lead people to choose to evacuate at higher rates than bluer and lighter colors do.
